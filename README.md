# Biotech Clinical Trial Platform

An FHE-based platform for confidential clinical trials in biotechnology, leveraging **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** to ensure the highest level of privacy and data integrity. This innovative platform is specifically designed for biotechnology companies to manage multi-center clinical trials where patient medical data and trial responses are encrypted end-to-end using FHE. 

## The Challenge of Clinical Trials

Conducting clinical trials in the biotech industry presents significant challenges. Data privacy and security are paramount, especially when handling sensitive patient information. Traditional methods often fall short in protecting this data, leading to potential breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and loss of trust from participants. With stringent medical regulations in place, it is essential for biotech companies to develop solutions that not only accelerate drug development but also protect the privacy of trial participants.

## The FHE Solution

Zama’s Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology addresses these challenges head-on. By implementing this technology through Zama's open-source libraries such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, our platform ensures that patient data remains secure throughout the trial process. FHE allows for computations on encrypted data, meaning that statistical analyses can be performed without ever exposing the underlying sensitive information. This capability enables regulatory compliance while significantly enhancing the integrity and trustworthiness of clinical trials.

## Core Functionalities

The Biotech Clinical Trial Platform offers a range of essential features:

- **End-to-End FHE Encryption:** All patient data and trial reactions are encrypted, safeguarding privacy.
- **Homomorphic Statistical Analysis:** Perform complex statistical analyses on encrypted data to derive insights while maintaining confidentiality.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Designed to adhere strictly to healthcare regulations, ensuring legal and ethical standards are met.
- **Accelerated Drug Development:** Streamline the clinical trial process to bring innovative therapies to market faster without compromising participant safety.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard:** An intuitive interface for monitoring trials and accessing analytics without compromising data privacy.

## Technology Stack

The primary components of our platform include:

- **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption SDK (zama-fhe SDK)**
- **Concrete** for advanced encryption schemes
- **Node.js** for backend services
- **Hardhat** for Ethereum development
- **Solidity** for smart contracts
